# Project 4 Part 2 JUNIT Testing

Contains code identical to above folder, except rearranged to work with Eclipse (what we used to use JUnit). Can be run by downloading as Eclipse Project and running either the `JavaTest` or `Project4Part2Driver` .java files. Requires a logs folder in the `/Project Code/src/` folder to run, but output and logs have been moved here for accessibility.
